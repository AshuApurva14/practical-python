paragraph = "This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was \
this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much \
of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but \
most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small \
green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't \
the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy."
