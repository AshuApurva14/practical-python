## Make it do Math

### Learn how to use +, -, *, /, and print() with numbers.

*Check out - [math_basics.py](./math_basics.py) for practical hands on.*


### Arithmetic Operator

**Operations**

Example

 - Addition(+)

	10 + 5 results in 15

- Subtraction(-)

	10 - 5 results in 5

- Multiplication(*)

	10 * 5 results in 50

- Division(/)

	10 / 5 results in 2

- Modulus(%)

10 % 5 results in 0

Note: The modulus operator (%) gives us the remainder after division.

**For example:**

Ace Editor
This prints 1 because 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1.

What’s happening here?
We use Python like a calculator, and it’s doing exactly what we say:

- adds (+)

- subtracts (-)

- multiplies (*)

- divides  (/)

Just like in math class, but a lot more fun (and forgiving).

What’s next?
Ready for something fun and practical? In the next hands-on project, you’ll calculate your age in days using Python! You’ll use the same math operators and print() function you just mastered—only this time, you’ll apply them to a real-life scenario. Let’s keep building your coding skills, one project at a time.

What’s next?
Right now, we’re running one-time calculations. But what if we want Python to remember something and reuse it later?

Next, we’ll explore variables! Let’s teach Python how to remember things for us.
