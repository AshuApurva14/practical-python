- In this level, we will be learning and exploring about *print()* function to learn how we can print any text in the output.

```
print("Thanks")

```

## Quick breakdown: What’s going on?

- You just used Python’s print() function:

- print() is how Python shows you messages on the screen.

- To make Python display text, put it in quotes ("Like this!"). Numbers don’t need quotes—just write: 42. If you put quotes around a number, like "42", Python treats it as text.

- Quotes tell Python, “Hey, treat this as text.”
