### This lesson will teach us how to combine words and numbers to create full sentences using variables.

```python
name = "Ava"
age = 25

print("Hi, my name is", name, "and I am", age, "years old.")

```

### Why commas?

In print(), commas separate each part of our message. Python puts them together and even adds spaces for us.


**We can mix:**

- Strings (text in quotes)

- Variables (like name, age)

- Numbers

**All in a single print() statement.**

```python

name = "Ava"
age = 25

print("Hi, my name is", name, "and I am", age,"years old.")

```

### Your turn: Build a fun message

```python

food = "pizza"
color = "green"
animal = "dolphin"

print("My favorite food is ", food, "my favorite color is ", color, " and I want a pet ", animal, "!")

# New solution after chnage

print(f"My favorite food is {animal}, my favorite color is {food}, and I want a pet {color} !")

```
